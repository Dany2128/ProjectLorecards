        He was the largest proto-dragon who had ever soared across Azeroth's
        skies. So mighty was the enormous creature that the beating of his wings
        could flatten entire forests." Galakrond was the largest proto-dragon of
        them all. With an insatiable hunger that actually drove him mad. Nothing
        could fill this beasts belly wich made him feast on his own felllow
        proto-drakes, slowly, turning him mad, almost corrupting his mind. Not
        long after he started to feast on his brethren he started growing
        necrotic limbs and dozens of old-god like eyes on his already afflicted
        form. Galakrond was defeated during a battle against the dragon aspects
        wich consisted of Malygos, Nozdormu, Neltharion, Alexstrasza and Ysera.
        After they defeated Galakrond, the aspects kept the truth about him a
        secret, hoping that noone will ever follow his path. In the World Of
        Warcraft expansion Wrath Of The Lich King you can travel to a zone
        called Dragonblight where you can take a look at Galakronds remains at
        "Galakrond's Rest".

        He was the first one to wake up, all alone, in search for the rest of
        his kin. Not knowing they existed but feeling that there has to be more
        out there. Aman'thul, the founding father of the pantheon, set out to
        discover the other nascent world-souls. Searching, jumping from
        world-soul to world-soul he slowly but surely awoken what would
        eventually become his siblings. Aman'thul and his siblings later on
        being known as The Pantheon, set out to stabilize the worlds. The sole
        purpose of the Pantheon was to bring order to the worlds. The Pantheon
        consisted of the following members: Aman'thul, Eonar, Norgannon,
        Golganneth, Aggramar and Sargeras.
